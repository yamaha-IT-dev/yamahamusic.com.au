	<p>If you're not a registered user, why don't you consider <a href="../customer.asp">joining our community</a></p>

	<h2>But I've already signed up as a customer</h2>
	
	<p>As an online customer your membership is very important to us. We also regard our online communities
	as equally important; they are a place where like minded individuals can share knowledge and discuss
	topics relating to Yamaha Music Australia activities and Yamaha products.</p>
	
	<p>When you sign up as a customer, you have the option of creating a username which will be used as
	your 'handle' when you participate in our discussion forums. Creating a handle ensures that we don't
	have to use your email address as the only way to identify you to other people in the discussion group.</a>
