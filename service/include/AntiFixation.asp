    ' This routine is intended to provide a degree of protection
    ' against Session Fixation attacks in classic ASP

    ' Session fixation attacks are a problem in ASP, since ASP does not
    ' allow you any access to the ASPSESSIONIDxxx cookie. Even invalidating
    ' the session does not alter the value of this cookie, preventing
    ' implementation of best practice recommendations, such as
    ' issuing new session cookies when the session is authenticated, or 
    ' invalidated.

    ' The basic premise of this routine is that we create a cookie that 
    ' we CAN control, e.g. ASPFIXATION, and assign a random value to this
    ' cookie when the session is authenticated. On subsequent pages, we 
    ' check the value of this cookie against the same variable stored in
    ' the user's session. If they do not match, access is denied.
    ' When the user logs out, the session should be invalidated, and so 
    ' by default, the cookie no longer matches the value in the session.
    Private Function RandomString(l)
        Dim value, i, r
        Randomize
        For i = 0 To l
            r = Int(Rnd * 62)
            If r<10 Then
                r = r + 48
            ElseIf r<36 Then
                r = (r - 10) + 65
            Else
                r = (r - 10 - 26) + 97
